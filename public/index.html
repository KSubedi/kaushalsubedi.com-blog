      I have been using Android since it was first launched. My first proper smartphone (if you don&rsquo;t count Symbian as smartphone operating system) was T-Mobile myTouch 3G, and since then I have used pretty much all the major mobile operating system and have owned a ton of flagship devices. From the legendary HTC HD2 to Motorola Defy to HTC Sensation to Blackberry Z10 to iPhone 6s, I have used it all.

      Here we go again, I know what you might be thinking. &ldquo;This guy was ranting about how Node.js Sucks a while ago and now he is on about Golang.&rdquo; - sounds like what you were thinking? Although I loved the move from Node.js to Golang initially and started using Go for pretty much everything I built, I soon found out about its con&rsquo;s and ran into issues I should not have.

      Microsoft recently released a new open source text editor called Visual Studio Code. It is based on Github&rsquo;s Electron platform and is a cross platform application that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X which is surprising considering it came from Microsoft. Surprisingly, it is a great editor when it comes to working with JavaScript and Node.js and basically anything front end (React, Angular&hellip;). One major gripe I had with it that was stopping me from making it my default editor for web application projects was that it used a concept of &ldquo;Working Files&rdquo; instead of tabs like most editors I have come across.

      So I recently got a new Chromebook. If you do not know what a Chromebook is, it is basically a laptop that can run Chrome browser + some more. I was at a Best Buy recently, and saw a nice little white colored plastic computer under the Google logo. It was the Acer CB3-111 that had Intel Baytrail processor and 2GB of Ram. The specs were nothing to be proud of, however after a few minutes of usage I decided to get it for myself.

      Being a full stack web developer is not easy. You not only have to worry about developing the application itself, but you also have to worry about managing the server stack, implementing a high availability system, configuring a backup system, creating a deployment system and a lot more. While having the knowledge of all these things is good, having to do these every time you start a project can be annoying, specially if it is just a small side project.

      Working as a systems administrator, there are many times where you want to automate things so that you don&rsquo;t have to do them manually. A lot of times I am working with OpenVZ nodes, I run into situations where I have to run a command in all vm&rsquo;s or reboot all vm&rsquo;s (don&rsquo;t reboot all in production node). Here is a simple linux command that will find all openvz vm&rsquo;s and reboot / restart or do anything with it.

      If you are a web developer, or any developer that has been catching up with latest technologies for that matter, I am sure you know about Node.js. It is a relatively new programming language built on top of Google&rsquo;s V8 Javascript parsing engine that allows you to build cross platform applications. Node.js is widely used as a backend language in a lot of web applications and a lot of big name companies like Paypal have adapted it as well.
